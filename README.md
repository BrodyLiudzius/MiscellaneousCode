# Miscellaneous Code

This repository contains some header-only C++ files I've written over time and occasionally reuse. It's generally written without any libraries or frameworks. Some of the code is written because I just needed some simple functions and it was easy to write it myself and others are written for learning and practice.

I make no guarantee that any code here is robust, well-tested, or maintained in any way. It's just code I've written for personal or school projects and only fits a standard of "good enough".
